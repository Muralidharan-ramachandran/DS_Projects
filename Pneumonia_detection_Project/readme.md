## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** with **transfer learning** to classify chest X-ray images as either **Pneumonia** or **Normal**. The trained model is deployed using **Streamlit** for user-friendly, real-time predictions.

> Pneumonia is a critical condition that benefits from early detection. Automating its detection helps speed up the diagnosis process and supports medical professionals.
